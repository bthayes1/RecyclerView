# RecyclerView
### ***Brandon Hayes***

## Description
I created this project to learn how to use RecyclerView. I first implemented a homogenous view RecyclerView and then once that worked, I moved to a heterogenous view. 



## Why did I make a whole project for this?
I am new to Android and the RecyclerView seems to be the foundation for almost all apps. I wanted to thoroughly learn this concept so I could apply it to more complex problems.
